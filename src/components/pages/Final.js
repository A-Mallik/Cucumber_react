        A special <span className="stickOut4">THANK YOU</span> to Simon Bhai, Sabbir (couldn't get his pic in time), and Juel for providing us with great knowledge and guidance. All three were incredible instructors and masters of their trade.
      We are very fortunate to have such great instructors teaching us here at TalenTech.
